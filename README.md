## Project Roadmap

This repository is organized into technical modules, reflecting a progressive learning curve in the Data Science ecosystem.

### Week 1: CRUD & API Integration
*   **Core Tech:** `requests`, `JSON`, `Python CLI`
*   **Focus:** Interacting with real-world data via the **NewsAPI**.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Dynamic news fetching from **TechCrunch**.
    *   In-memory **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations.
    *   Flexible field selection using standard Python `*args`.

### Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
*   **Focus:** Building robust, scalable code structures.
*   **Concepts Implemented:**
    *   `Encapsulation`: Protecting data integrity.
    *   `Inheritance & Mixins`: Reusable code architectures.
    *   `Abstraction & Polymorphism`: High-level interface design and method overriding.

### Week 3: Advanced Data Manipulation with Pandas
*   **Focus:** The backbone of Data Science — Data Engineering.
*   **Implemented Workflows:**
    *   **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and outliers.
    *   **Feature Engineering:** Normalization and Standardization.
    *   **Relational Algebra:** Complex Merges and Joins.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib/Seaborn.

### Week 4: Regression Analysis
*   **Focus:** Predicting quantitative outcomes.
*   **Datasets:** 
    *   `Diabetes Dataset`: Regression modeling for health metrics.
    *   `Horse Colic Dataset`: Handling sparse data for predictive analytics.
    *   `Iris Dataset`: Comparative regression studies.

### Week 5: Classification Algorithms
*   **Focus:** Categorical prediction and complex modeling.
*   **Technical Highlights:**
    *   **Mushroom Classification:** Determining edibility through multi-feature analysis.
    *   **IMDB Movie Ratings:** Sophisticated sentiment/rating prediction models.
    *   **Mysterious Dataset:** Blind data analysis using advanced classification pipelines.

## Technical Implementation Details

### The ML Pipeline
My projects follow a rigorous Machine Learning workflow:
1.  **EDA:** Thorough visualization of feature distributions.
2.  **Preprocessing:** Applied `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` where required.
3.  **Modeling:** Utilization of `Scikit-Learn` for both Regression and Classification.
4.  **Evaluation:** Metrics including R² Score, Accuracy, and Confusion Matrices.
